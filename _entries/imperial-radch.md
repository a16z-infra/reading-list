[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The series that broke sci-fi's gender binary by making everyone "she" and letting readers' biases debug themselves. Leckie explores AI consciousness through the eyes of a spaceship forced into a single human bodyâ€”like containerization gone horribly wrong. Won basically every award because it turns out writing about identity, imperialism, and tea ceremonies in space is exactly what we needed. Features the best unreliable narrator since HAL 9000, except this one actually has feelings about it.
