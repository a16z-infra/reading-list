This is a great space opera that's reminiscient of Banks' *Culture* series. The idea is that spaceship AIs (and some people) can control several bodies at once called "ancillaries." Consciousness is shared across all bodies, unless/ until something goes wrong. Leckie uses this device to tell a dramatic and often funny story about revenge, politics, and consciousness. Like Banks, she has a talent for folding local stories, with engaging settings and characters, into a sweeping global saga. Leckie also draws comparisons to LeGuin for her gender-neutral characters who are always called "she."
