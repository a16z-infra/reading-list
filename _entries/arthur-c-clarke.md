[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The RAF radar specialist who wrote the paper that invented communication satellites in 1945, then spent the rest of his life writing about what comes next. Clarke gave us the three laws that define sci-fi's relationship with magic, the most famous being "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." He co-wrote *2001* with Kubrick through a feedback loop of novel and screenplay that nobody can quite untangle, creating the monolithâ€”sci-fi's most perfect artifact because it does everything and explains nothing. Clarke's futures are full of engineers who build space elevators for breakfast and alien artifacts that treat physics like suggestions. He showed us that the universe's greatest mystery isn't how it works, but why it bothers to. Also predicted the iPad in 1968, because of course he did.
