Like Asimov, Heinlein was prolific (publishing more than 30 novels) and had an enormous influence on the genre. He served as an engineer in the US Navy, and as a result brought a degree of technical rigor to his writing that was rare for his era. More importantly though, Heinlein used sci-fi scenarios (e.g. discovering Martian life in *Stranger in a Strange Land*) to deeply examine social constructs, and to poke & prod at the norms of his day. He views were seemingly fluid and open-minded: he comes across at various times as a libertarian, a socialist, a supporter of the military, a staunch opponent of racism and sexism, and an advocate for free love, among other things. But he was rarely preachy. Like Philip Dick, he wove his themes into fun, fast-paced stories, well worth reading.
