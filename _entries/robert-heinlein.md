[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The Naval Academy dropout who became sci-fi's most controversial grandfather, writing competence porn before we had a name for it. Heinlein invented powered exoskeletons, gave us TANSTAAFL ("There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch"), and spent decades arguing that citizenship should be earned, free love is logical, and engineers should run everything. His politics swung from New Deal socialist to libertarian icon, but his heroes were always hyper-competent polymaths who could "change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly." Specialization, he said, is for insects.
