[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] Before Gaiman turned out to be problematic, he created the definitive modern mythology in comic form. Dream (aka Morpheus) is basically a systems administrator for human consciousnessâ€”when he goes offline, people can't sleep or dream properly. The series follows his journey from imprisoned daemon process to learning that even anthropomorphic personifications need to refactor their code sometimes. Literary enough to win awards usually reserved for "real" books, dark enough to make goths happy, and smart enough to reference everything from Shakespeare to serial killers. If you think comics are just superheroes punching things, this will debug that assumption.
