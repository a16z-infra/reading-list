An absolute classic of the Englishman-traveling-the-galaxy genre. It follows the adventures of a hapless man in his pyjamas (Arthur Dent), several incorrigible aliens, and a depressed robot as they try their best to understand a galaxy that doesn't really make a lot of sense. We won't spoil it with too much plot description, but this series is charming, funny, and absurd. Plus it has a real message to deliver about the meaning of life. Which turns out to be an integer.
