Bug-like aliens are coming for Earth at an unknown future time... that's suspiciously similar to the 1980s. Only a group of intelligent young children can save us, particularly a brilliant young leader named Ender. The story is pretty straightforward and a lot of fun, centered around a series of war simulations in the training academy. And it really resonates for anyone who felt bullied as a kid, and/or spent most of their childhood playing video games. The sequels are also great, covering Ender's life after the war, living with and making amends for his actions as a soldier.
