Arrakis. Sand worms. The spice. Paul Muad'Dib. This is the series that brought epic sci-fi to the mainstream. It's also one of the first series that demonstrated sci-fi should be taken seriously, in this case as an allegory for geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In case you've only seen the (very well done) movies, do yourself a favor and read the books, which are infinitely deeper and more intricately plotted. The last three fast-forward several thousand years and get a little weird (in a good way!).
