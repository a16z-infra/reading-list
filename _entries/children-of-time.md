You can learn a lot about a work of sci-fi by studying the biography of its authors: Arthur C. Clark served in the Royal Air Force, and studied physics, so naturally his work explores deep space; Greg Egan is a mathematician, so naturally his work is meticulously accurate when it comes to portraying humans under computational duress. Adrian Tchaikovsky is a zoologist, so naturally his work probes the implications of super-intelligent spiders in a universe far in the future.  Across alternating chapters in Children of Time, humans cycle through scarcity, class politics, and technological decay, while spiders (in an experiment gone wrong, or right, depending on how you look at it) evolve from cave tools to astronomy and planet-scale coordination (the original target in the experiment were monkeys, which were killed in a misdeployed spacecraft payload). Itâ€™s a terrifying conceit, but the ending is (spoiler alert) quite optimistic.
