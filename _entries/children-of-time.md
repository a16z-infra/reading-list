[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] What happens when your terraforming upload accidentally creates a spider civilization instead of monkeys? Tchaikovsky answers with hard science, evolutionary biology, and arachnids that will make you reconsider your debugging terminology. This series does for spiders what Charlotte's Web did, except with more distributed computing metaphors and existential dread about what constitutes consciousness. You'll never kill a spider again. You might even respect their architecture patterns.
