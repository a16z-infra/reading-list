In contrast to HG Wells, Jules Verne was an infra maximalist and an open optimist. Like many modern writers, he built on real scientific concepts of his time to imagine plausible new technologies and amazing new human capabilities. He researched everything obsessively, including a fully realized submarine design for Captain Nemo's Nautilus in *Twenty Thousand Leagues* and remarkably accurate orbital calculations in *From the Earth to the Moon*. After the publication of *Around the World in Eighty Days*, several newspaper reporters did, in fact, manage to go around the world in less than 80 days. Verne's work is fundamentally about exploring the unknown, pushing the frontiers of human experience, and turning engineers into heroes.
