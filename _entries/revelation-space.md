These books read like a cousin of *The Three Body Problem*: grand space opera, with plausible treatment of near-lightspeed travel, where humanity has to fight for survival in a hostile universe. Reynolds has a PhD in astrophysics, and you can see this influence in the cool technology he imagines (e.g. "cryoarithmetic engines" that cool spacecraft via endothermic computation). The world building is also very strong. On the flip side, the characters feel a little flat, and Reynolds can get bogged down in hyper-rational explanations of what's going on. But the slow-burning plots get more engaging the more you read. The *Dreyfus* books are possibly better better than the original *Inhibitor* series.
