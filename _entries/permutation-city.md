An ideal evening pairing with Permutation City might be spinning up scenes on the [World Labs Marble explorer](https://marble.worldlabs.ai/), and contemplating just how far we might be from the future the book articulates – one in which “Copies” of human consciousness run in computational simulations that can be slowed down or sped up, completely independent of “time” in the external world. In Egan’s book, Paul Durham recruits Copies to participate in an experiment, resulting in a bootstrapped world that evolves into a fully recursive universe. There are tons of great details in here, one of which is a highly mercenary QIPS exchange (that’s “quadrillion instructions per second”), which might feel evocative to any engineer currently buying compute from a hyperscaler.
