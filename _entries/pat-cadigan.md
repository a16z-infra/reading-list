Cadigan was dubbed the "Queen of Cyberpunk" because she centered people rather than chrome in a genre that often drifted into gadget worship. *Synners* is her most complete statement: a near-future LA where neural jacks, pirate broadcasters, and corporate signal jockeys remix pop detritus for profit—until a runaway bio-digital virus starts crashing both brains and the global network. The book expertly balances tech speculation (live-coded music videos, AI-assisted creativity, the socioeconomics of bandwidth) with empathy for artists, addicts, and gig workers fighting to keep their identities under surveillance capitalism. It reads like a mixtape of Gibson, MTV, and early internet boards, but with warmer human stakes.
