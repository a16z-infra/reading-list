Gibson is the main creator of cyberpunk, and his books created much of the aesthetic and vocabulary around the first internet wave (including VR, AI, and the word "cyberspace"). You can palpably feel Gibson's influence on later works like *The Matrix*, *Cyberpunk 2077*, and many many others. Reading one of these books is kind of like visiting a dystopian, high-tech, 1980s-style, Japanese-ish vision for the future. They are also just great, gritty sci-fi stories. Gibson has a talent for making you care about characters who are often rough, self-centered, and vaguely unethical. If at first you can't figure out what's going on... it's probably because Gibson was [on acid](https://highprofiles.info/interview/william-gibson/).
