The ImageNet creator's memoir reads like a startup founder's journey, except the product is modern AI and the debugging involves teaching computers to see cats. Li shows how computer vision went from "maybe computers can identify edges?" to "oh no, they're generating deepfakes." Part immigrant story, part research memoir, part warning about what happens when you successfully teach silicon to perceive reality. Essential reading for understanding why your image classifier thinks that chihuahua is a muffin.
