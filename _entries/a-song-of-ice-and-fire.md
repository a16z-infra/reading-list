Often known by the name of the first book in the series, *Game of Thrones*, which HBO used as the title for their adaptation.

The series reads like a political thriller set in a late-medieval sandbox; dragons and ice zombies exist, but the real tension is in the dynastic maneuvering, unreliable alliances, and the toll of war on ordinary people. Especially early in the series, Martin displays a knack for chaos that will have you constantly questioning who from the cast will live. Rotating POV chapters let you inhabit dozens of characters across the social ladder. Martin presents believable characters up and down that ladder, too.

The elephant in the room is that the series started in 1996, and Martin (sometimes referred to as GRRM) still has not finished it. The final two books remain forthcoming, but the five published entries already form one of the definitive epics in fantasy.
