While occupying the same genre as other cyberpunk trailblazers, Scott tackled topics others didn't, and formulated a worldview of community that was unique enough to etch out her own name. She is most well known for *Trouble and Her Friends*. After federal crackdowns make old-school cyberspace intrusion a capital crime, legendary hacker Trouble and her ex-partner Cerise go straight—only to learn someone is impersonating Trouble’s handle and burning their community. The book dives into VR decking, body modification, and jurisdictional lawfare, but its real power is the messy relationship drama and the way Scott foregrounds chosen family, consent, and club culture. It won a Lambda Literary Award for good reason.
