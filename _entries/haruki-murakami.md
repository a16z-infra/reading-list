[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT OR KILL] The Japanese author who writes like your code at 3 AMâ€”surreal, full of unexpected connections, and somehow it all works even though you can't explain why. His books feature disappearing cats, parallel worlds accessed through wells, and jazz-loving protagonists who cook pasta while contemplating existence. Murakami proves that you can write the same book 20 different ways and have each one be mysteriously compelling. His secret? Every novel is basically magical realism Stack Overflow.
