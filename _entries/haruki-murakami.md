García Márquez's long lost Japanese cousin (in a literary sense). Murakami made a genre out of weird, surreal, and very relatable coming-of-age stories. They have vanishing cats, wells that lead to alternate dimensions, mysterious women who may or may not exist, and protagonists who listen to jazz records while cooking spaghetti at 2am. Murakami is master at sucking you into these elaborate, bizarre stories and making you feel the loneliness/ confusion/ angst/ etc of his teen protagonists.
