The premise of this series is what infra people might call software-defined humans. Bodies are the hardware. The software (our consciousness) can be downloaded, uploaded, transmitted over interplanetary distances, and backed up in case of death. This idea is undeniably cool, and Morgan builds a dark, cyberpunk universe around it. He exploits the concept brilliantly to tell a series of detective stories, battles stories, and trimphs of good(ish) over evil. As you might expect, it's action packed, and there is a lot of sex and violence. Netflix tried to capture it - the first season is pretty good - but the books are darker and smarter.
