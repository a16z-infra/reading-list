Effinger’s Budayeen novels were a rare cyberpunk detour away from neon Tokyo knockoffs into a bustling, Middle Eastern future city built over New Orleans French Quarter bones. *When Gravity Fails* follows Marîd Audran, an aimless hustler who’s proud of staying “unwired” in a society where personality modules and neural add-ons let citizens rent new skills or swap identities on the fly. When a serial killer starts abusing those mods, Marîd gets dragooned into both police work and body augments, forcing him to reconcile faith, personal autonomy, and newfound power. The book feels like Chandler noir filtered through Arabic slang, queer nightlife, and postcolonial politics—a fresh angle that still feels underused in sci-fi.
