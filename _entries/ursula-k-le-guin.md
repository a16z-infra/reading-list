LeGuin was a pioneer of a more literary brand of science fiction. She has all the hallmarks we've come to know as sci-fi, including rich world building, starships, anarchist political strains, and cool new technology (like the ansbile: a faster-than-light communicator that has been borrowed by a thousand later authors). But she also wrote beautiful, poetic prose and explored the deeper, murkier aspects of her subject matter - including, famously, sex and gender identity. LeGuin stands out as one of the few female sci-fi writers of her time, but don't be tempted to qualify her success. She was the first author, period, to win both the Hugo and Nebula awards in the same year, for *The Left Hand of Darkness*. Then she did it again with *The Dispossessed*.
