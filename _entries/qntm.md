Sam Hughes (aka qntm) turned an SCP Foundation fan-favorite concept into a full novel about information that refuses to be perceived. The Antimemetics Division fights entities you forget as soon as you encounter them, so the book weaponizes unreliable narration, time loops, and backup copies of memories the same way other thrillers use explosions. It’s clever, unsettling, and surprisingly hopeful about institutional resilience in the face of reality-warping threats. Is this your first day at work?
