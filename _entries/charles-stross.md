Stross is the patron saint of speculative thought experiments that mutate halfway through the page. He’s hopped across far-future economics (*Accelerando*), Lovecraftian spy bureaucracies (*The Laundry Files*), and alt-history trade wars (*The Merchant Princes*), usually with dense but funny prose and a network-ops view of society. *Accelerando* is the pure Stross: a linked-family saga that starts with venture-funded upload experiments and sprints through the Singularity into a post-human solar system where legal contracts run on quantum computers and uploaded lobsters sue for personhood. If you want a crash course in what runaway compounding tech might feel like to live through, this is it.
