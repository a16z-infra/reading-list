Asimov is often considered the father of modern science fiction. Among nearly 500 (!) published stories, he wrote one of the first epic space operas in the *Foundation* series, and he explored the relationship between humans and intelligent machines in the *Robot* series. These books are still super relevant today, both as great stories on their own and as archetypes for new sci-fi writers. Asimov also just has an uncanny ability to weave technology into the broad sweep of human history and evolution. His work can be hard to access, since a lot of it was published initally in serial form. We suggest starting with the original *Foundation* trilogy and [*I, Robot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot), then going deeper if you want to see how it all ties together. The Apple TV series for *Foundation* is also very good.
