[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] Canterbury Tales in space, where each story could be its own novel and probably should have been. Simmons throws in killer robots, time-traveling tombs, a tree-ship full of Templars, and an AI TechnoCore that makes you really appreciate air-gapped systems. The first book is a masterpiece of structure, the second explains everything (maybe too much), and the last two... exist. Features poetry that's actually plot-relevant and the best divine tech support ticket system you'll ever read about.
