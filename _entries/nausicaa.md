[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] Yes, the Studio Ghibli guy wrote a manga, and it's darker and more complex than anything he animated. Nausicaä is basically a distributed systems engineer for the ecosystem, trying to debug why the toxic jungle keeps expanding and giant insects attack human settlements. Turns out it's not a bug, it's a feature—the jungle is Earth's garbage collector, cleaning up humanity's toxic legacy. Miyazaki spent 12 years building a world where bioengineering, ancient technology, and ecological systems create cascading failures that only someone who truly understands the whole system can fix. The movie covers about 20% of the story; the manga goes full eco-philosophy-meets-engineering-manual.
