Wells found the perfect tone for modern infrastructure people: a socially anxious security android that has hacked its governor module, renamed itself Murderbot, and would rather binge serials than babysit hapless clients. Across novellas and novels, the series pairs tight thriller plots with dry humor, corporate malfeasance, and the kind of ops details you'd expect from a world where everything is a service contract. Each mission nudges Murderbot toward inconvenient feelings about autonomy, friendship, and the difference between being property and being a person, all without losing the propulsive pacing.
