[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The computer science professor who gave us the term "technological singularity" and then wrote novels exploring what happens next. His aliens are genuinely alien (dog-like pack minds that think in parallel!), and his universe operates on network protocols where bandwidth determines intelligence. If you've ever wondered what happens when ping times approach infinity, Vinge has answers. In his Zones of Thought universe, physics literally throttles computation (the Slow Zone vs. the Beyond vs. the Transcend), and "Powers" feel like FOOMed AGI. He also anticipated modern cyberculture with "True Names" and gave us a near-future AR classic about ubiquitous computing, security, and memetics in "Rainbows End."
