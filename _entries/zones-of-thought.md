The story is pretty creative and feels zero derivative from anything else that came before (or even after). Vinge's aliens are genuinely alien (like dog-like pack minds that think in parallel). There's also buried super intelligence, bonsai things on wheels, a galactic immune system against super intelligences, computational "zones" limited by physics, etc. It's a weird trip where you can probably never predict what would happen next.
