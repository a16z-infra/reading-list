The programmer-turned-CEO who personally optimized Pok√©mon Gold/Silver to fit two regions on one cartridge. This collection captures Iwata's philosophy of making games that are fun for everyone, not just the hardcore. He approached business problems like debugging code: understand the system, find the bottleneck, optimize with elegance. If you've ever said "please understand" unironically, this book explains why. Also contains the best management advice from someone who actually shipped products people loved.
