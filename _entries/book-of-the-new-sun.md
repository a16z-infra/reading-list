*BotNS*, part of the "science fantasy" subgenre, is kind of a puzzle by design. It takes place in the distant future, but the setting is medieval. There is some advanced technology, but how it works is never really explained. The main character (Severian) is a professional torturer - yep, that's a thing - and you often get the sense he's hiding the truth of what's going on. Yet despite all this, you generally root for him and get engaged in his quest to find his place in the world, which wraps up in clever and dramatic fashion. It also helps that the characters are truly unique and that the prose is among the best ever written in sci-fi/ fantasy.
