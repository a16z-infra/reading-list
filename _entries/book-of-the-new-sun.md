[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The mechanical engineer who wrote fantasy so dense it requires multiple parsings, like badly documented legacy code that turns out to be genius. Wolfe created a dying Earth where the sun is going out, technology is indistinguishable from magic, and the narrator lies to you constantlyâ€”but consistently, so you can reverse-engineer the truth. This series is a puzzle box wrapped in gorgeous prose, where every re-read reveals new layers of meaning. Warning: you will join online forums to argue about what actually happened.
