[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT OR KILL] The Colombian author who wrote *One Hundred Years of Solitude* and other books that are basically magical realism Stack Overflow.

Murakami proves that you can write the same book 20 different ways and have each one be mysteriously compelling. His secret? Every novel is basically magical realism Stack Overflow.
