A giant of Latin American literature. García Márquez's superpower is his ability to weave fantasy elements - like levitating priests, rain that lasts for years, insomnia plagues, or women ascending to heaven while folding bedsheets - naturally into stories of everyday life. And he uses this power brilliantly, not only to build a magical, alternate version of Latin America, but to draw out deep seated feelings and experiences of his characters/ readers. His sprawling family sagas explore solitude, love, power, and the circular nature of time. Winner of the 1982 Nobel Prize.
