Akira opens with a bomb that explodes over 1992-era Japan, setting off WWIII (not unlike the bombs that were detonated over 1945-era Japan, ending WWII). In the manga, biker friends Kaneda and Tetsuo collide with a secret psychic program, awakening Tetsuo’s powers and, at the same time, the buried weaponized child Akira. Tetsuo’s addiction to power fractures the city into warring factions as Akira’s return unleashes catastrophic destruction. The way that extreme violence can alternatively freeze or catalyze progress (especially in a militaristic context) is one of the core ideas explored in Akira, which originated as a serialized manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that ran from 1982-1990.
