[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] Six volumes of what happens when you give psychic powers to angry teenagers in post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo. But really it's about uncontrolled exponential growthâ€”whether that's military technology, urban development, or a kid who can't stop his powers from scaling. Otomo drew every chunk of debris in the destroyed city, every motorcycle detail, every explosion with obsessive precision. The anime compressed 2000+ pages into 2 hours; the manga is the full stack trace. Influenced basically every piece of cyberpunk media that came after, from *The Matrix* to *Stranger Things*. Still the gold standard for how to draw motion in static images and systemic collapse in real-time.
