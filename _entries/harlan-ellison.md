Ellison wrote like every page might combust if he slowed down. Across short fiction, TV scripts, essays, and the landmark *Dangerous Visions* anthologies he edited, he hammered home that science fiction could be confrontational, political, and wildly experimental. *I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream* is a claustrophobic nightmare about the last humans tortured by a sadistic AI—equal parts Cold War trauma, body horror, and moral fable. Ellison could be abrasive, litigious, and often furious with the industry, but his refusal to sand down the edges opened the door for New Wave writers who wanted speculative fiction to feel like the counterculture.
