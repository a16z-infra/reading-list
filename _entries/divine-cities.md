[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT OR KILL] Gods are dead, but their miracles are still running in production causing legacy issues. Bennett creates a world where deities operated like infrastructureâ€”when you kill them, all their divine services crash. It's urban fantasy for people who understand technical debt, with a protagonist who solves mysteries using something between archaeology and systems debugging. Also features the best divine tech support ticket system you'll ever read about.
