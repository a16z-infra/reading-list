A great manga that was made into a [great anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell) (and if we may editorialize, [a slightly less-great live-action film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(2017_film))). The plot centers around the special intelligence agency Public Security Section 9, which hunts criminals in a near future where most people run “cyberbrains,” led by full-body cyborg Major Motoko Kusanagi. Their central case targets the Puppet Master, an emergent AI that claims personhood and ultimately fuses with Kusanagi to create a new hybrid consciousness. Many of the best details in Shirow’s work occur at the beginning of certain chapters, with textbook-like illustrated introductions to some of the manga’s core concepts, like a 50,000x-enlarged neurochip that undergirds the aforementioned cyberbrain technology, and “Fuchikoma” robots that reconcile their shared consciousness at the end of a working day.
