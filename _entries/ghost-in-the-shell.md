[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The manga that asked "what happens when you can fork() a human consciousness?" before we even had GitHub. Major Kusanagi is a cyborg cop hunting hackers in a world where the line between human and machine is a gradient, not a boundary. Shirow imagined brain-computer interfaces, ghost hacking, and standalone complexes while most of us were still figuring out dial-up. Dense with technical footnotes that read like documentation for technology that doesn't exist yet. The anime adaptation is gorgeous, but the manga has 10x more ideas per page, including prescient thoughts on AI consciousness, network security, and what happens when your soul runs on software.
