[THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] A Byzantine historian writes space opera and it's exactly as intricate and politically complex as you'd expect. Martine gives us an empire that runs on poetry, algorithms that might be people, and the best examination of how language shapes thought since... well, since actual linguists started writing sci-fi. These books make you feel smarter just by osmosis. Also features the most realistic depiction of email anxiety in the far future.
