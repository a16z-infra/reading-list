This is space opera written by a Byzantine historian, so it's as intricate and politically complex as you'd expect. The world in this series has a unique texture: kind of Armenian/ Central Asian, with some Jewish and Aztec motifs. The thematic focus is heavy on culture, identity, and use of language, and the main subject is an empire that runs on poetry. While the plot and tech are not totally novel, this series is thoughtfully crafted and super engaging.  It also features a highly realistic depiction of email anxiety.
