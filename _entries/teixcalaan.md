This is space opera written by a Byzantine historian. It's just about as intricate and politically complex as you'd expect. And the world Martine crafts has a unique texture; kind of Armenian/ Central Asian, with some Jewish and Aztec motifs. The thematic focus is heavy on culture, identity, and use of language.. the main subject is an empire that runs on poetry. While it's not totally novel in plot or tech concepts, this series is thoughtfully crafted and super engaging.  Also features a highly realistic depiction of email anxiety.
