Kind of a sci fi descendant of William Gibson. Stephenson's books are often cyberpunk-ish and explore themes around the metaverse, distributed computing, and biological augmentation. He also comes up with some truly wild ideas, like the Drummers - a cult living in a cave that collectively performs large-scale computations through hallucinogenic drugs and endless sex - or cryptocurrency. At their best, Stephenson's books are diligently researched, thought provoking, and funny. Fair warning, most of these books don't have endings (they literally stop mid-sentence).
