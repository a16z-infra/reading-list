China is likely the biggest sci-fi market in the world, but it didn't have a landmark homegrown talent until Liu published *The Three-Body Problem*. These books open with a painful political scene from the Cultural Revolution, then sweep through realistic astrophysics, VR simulations, family/ friend drama, Fermi's paradox, and planet-scale efforts to ensure humanity's survival. Liu does a fantastic job blending the science, space, and human elements together into an engaging story (now also a Netflix show). Here's hoping this just the start of non-Western sci-fi, and new science fiction ideas, entering the mainstream.
