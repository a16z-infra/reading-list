# a16z Infra Reading List

![image](header.png)

This is a list of books and authors that at least one member of the a16z infra team read and loved. It's heavy on science fiction because sci-fi is the most infra-y literary genre: it's about new technology, new systems, and the people who devote their lives to building and understanding them.

We hope other infra people will like these books too! Please open a PR for any changes or additions.

- [*Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) series by [Frank Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert): Arrakis. Sand worms. The spice. Paul Muad'Dib. This is the series that brought epic sci-fi to the mainstream. It's also one of the first series that demonstrated sci-fi should be taken seriously, in this case as an allegory for geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In case you've only seen the (very well done) movies, do yourself a favor and read the books, which are infinitely deeper and more intricately plotted. The last three fast-forward several thousand years and get a little weird (in a good way!).

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/DoAndroidsDream.png">

- [Philip K Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick): Dick's contribution to sci-fi is hard to overstate. All of his ~150 novels and short stories have at least one genuinely new idea: catching crime before it happens; changing who won WWII; editing human memories; etc. Most are also told in a fun and fast-paced way, and many of his new inventions have an irrepressible optimistic bent to them (despite sometimes dark subject matter). His stories have been heavily adapted into movies and TV shows, and in many ways changed how we as a society think about the future. Much of Dick's work was written 50+ years ago, but it still feels fresh, as if it was written for our time. This is a very short list of some of his best works.
  - [*The Minority Report*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report) (1956)
  - [*The Man in the High Castle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle) (1962)

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/53/Banksphlebas.jpg">

- [*Culture*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series) series by [Iain M. Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_M._Banks): Sci-fi nerds love this series, but it's criminally unknown among casual readers. The setting is a hypothetical "post-scarcity" future in which space travel is trivial, machine intelligence is highly advanced, and most physical needs / desires have been solved. The books ask the question: what happens next, once we have everything we wanted? But more importantly, the stories are just beautifully crafted, and the characters (human, alien, and machine) feel completely novel. You could almost picture each book as a (really weird) dramatic play. As a bonus, if you read this series, you will get the joke about SpaceX's [spaceport names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship).

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/Neuromancer_%28Book%29.jpg">

- [*Sprawl trilogy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprawl_trilogy) by [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson): Gibson is the main creator of cyberpunk, and his books created much of the aesthetic and vocabulary around the first internet wave (including VR, AI, and the word "cyberspace"). You can palpably feel Gibson's influence on later works like *The Matrix*, *Cyberpunk 2077*, and many many others. Reading one of these books is kind of like visiting a dystopian, high-tech, 1980s-style, Japanese-ish vision for the future. They are also just great, gritty sci-fi stories. Gibson has a talent for making you care about characters who are often rough, self-centered, and vaguely unethical. If at first you can't figure out what's going on... it's probably because Gibson was [on acid](https://highprofiles.info/interview/william-gibson/).

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bd/H2G2_UK_front_cover.jpg">

- [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) series by [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams): An absolute classic of the Englishman-traveling-the-galaxy genre. It follows the adventures of a hapless man in his pyjamas (Arthur Dent), several incorrigible aliens, and a depressed robot as they try their best to understand a galaxy that doesn't really make a lot of sense. We won't spoil it with too much plot description, but this series is charming, funny, and absurd. Plus it has a real message to deliver about the meaning of life. Which turns out to be an integer.

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e4/Ender%27s_game_cover_ISBN_0312932081.jpg">

- [*Ender's Saga*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) series by [Orson Scott Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card): Bug-like aliens are coming for Earth at an unknown future time... that's suspiciously similar to the 1980s. Only a group of intelligent young children can save us, particularly a brilliant young leader named Ender. The story is pretty straightforward and a lot of fun, centered around a series of war simulations in the training academy. And it just really resonates emotionally for anyone who felt bullied as a kid, and/or spent most of their childhood playing video games. The sequels are also great, covering Ender's life after the war, living with and making amends for his actions as a soldier.

### Classics (A tier) [⬆️](#table-of-contents)
> These books all had massive impact when they were published and are still great reads today. Some feel a little dated now, so you can skip this section if you don't want to dive into sci-fi history.

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d9/Foundation_-_Isaac_Asimov_%28Gnome_1951%29.jpg">

- [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov): Asimov is often considered the father of modern science fiction. Among nearly 500 (!) published stories, he wrote one of the first epic space operas in the *Foundation* series, and he explored the relationship between humans and intelligent machines in the *Robot* series. These books are still super relevant today, both as great stories on their own and as archetypes for new sci-fi writers. Asimov also just has an uncanny ability to weave technology into the broad sweep of human history and evolution. His work can be hard to access, since a lot of it was published initally in serial form. We suggest starting with the original *Foundation* trilogy and [*I, Robot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot), then going deeper if you want to see how it all ties together. The Apple TV series for *Foundation* is also very good.
  - [*Foundation* series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) (1942-1953)
  - [*Robot* series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_series_(Asimov)) (1940-1995)
  - [*Galactic Empire* series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(series)) (1945–1952)

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Two_complete_science_adventure_books_1951win_n4.jpg">

- [HG Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells): Wells reads like a grumpy Leonardo da Vinci. His stories are intelligent and well thought-out, often putting up a mirror to polite society (e.g. *War of the Worlds* was written at the peak of British imperialism). He also proved to be a visionary, writing about concepts like time travel, alien invasions, and genetic engineering before those ideas were well known. Wells' worldview, though, was oddly anti-technology. His stories usually ended badly, and included *other* technological advances like atomic bombs (a phrase he may have coined), tanks, and widespread air combat. So Wells was not an infra maximalist, but his work is too important to ignore.
  - [*The Time Machine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine) (1895)
  - [*The War of the Worlds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds) (1898)
  - [*The Invisible Man*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man) (1897)
  - [*The Island of Doctor Moreau*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau) (1896)

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/A_Journey_to_the_Centre_of_the_Earth-1874.jpg">

- [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne): In contrast to HG Wells, Jules Verne was an infra maximalist and an open optimist. Like many modern writers, he built on real scientific concepts of his time to imagine plausible new technologies and amazing new human capabilities. He researched everything obsessively, including a fully realized submarine design for Captain Nemo's Nautilus in *Twenty Thousand Leagues* and remarkably accurate orbital calculations in *From the Earth to the Moon*. After the publication of *Around the World in Eighty Days*, several newspaper reporters did, in fact, manage to go around the world in less than 80 days. Verne's work is fundamentally about exploring the unknown, pushing the frontiers of human experience, and turning engineers into heroes.

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land_%281961%29_front_cover%2C_first_edition.jpg">

- [Robert Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Heinlein): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The Naval Academy dropout who became sci-fi's most controversial grandfather, writing competence porn before we had a name for it. Heinlein invented powered exoskeletons, gave us TANSTAAFL ("There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch"), and spent decades arguing that citizenship should be earned, free love is logical, and engineers should run everything. His politics swung from New Deal socialist to libertarian icon, but his heroes were always hyper-competent polymaths who could "change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly." Specialization, he said, is for insects.

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/2001_A_Space_Odyssey-Arthur_C._Clarke.jpg">

- [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The RAF radar specialist who wrote the paper that invented communication satellites in 1945, then spent the rest of his life writing about what comes next. Clarke gave us the three laws that define sci-fi's relationship with magic, the most famous being "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." He co-wrote *2001* with Kubrick through a feedback loop of novel and screenplay that nobody can quite untangle, creating the monolith—sci-fi's most perfect artifact because it does everything and explains nothing. Clarke's futures are full of engineers who build space elevators for breakfast and alien artifacts that treat physics like suggestions. He showed us that the universe's greatest mystery isn't how it works, but why it bothers to. Also predicted the iPad in 1968, because of course he did.
  - [*2001: A Space Odyssey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey) (1968)
  - [*Rendezvous with Rama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama) (1973)

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/TheLeftHandOfDarkness1stEd.jpg">

- [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The anthropologist's daughter who treated science fiction like a controlled experiment in being human. Le Guin didn't just write about other worlds—she built them from the inside out, complete with languages, myths, and gender systems that make you question why we do things the way we do. She gave us the ansible (FTL communication that every space opera since has borrowed), anarchist utopias that actually work, and wizards whose greatest enemy is their own shadow. First person to win both Hugo and Nebula awards in the same year, twice, because when you write *The Left Hand of Darkness* and *The Dispossessed*, the universe bends the rules. Her prose reads like poetry that happens to contain starships. Also wrote the most devastating takedown of commercialized sci-fi in her "Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction"—sometimes the story isn't about the spear, but about the basket that carries life home.
  - [*A Wizard of Earthsea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wizard_of_Earthsea) (1968)
  - [*The Left Hand of Darkness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) (1969)

### Very good books (A tier) [⬆️](#table-of-contents)

> These are all contemporary books and very very good. Highly recommended.

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0f/Threebody.jpg">

- [*Remembrance of Earth's Past*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) series by [Liu Cixin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin): China is likely the biggest sci-fi market in the world, but it didn't have a landmark homegrown talent until Liu published *The Three-Body Problem*. These books open with a painful political scene from the Cultural Revolution, then sweep through realistic astrophysics, VR simulations, family/ friend drama, Fermi's paradox, and planet-scale efforts to ensure humanity's survival. Liu does a fantastic job blending the science, space, and human elements together into an engaging story (now also a Netflix show). Here's hoping this just the start of non-Western sci-fi, and new science fiction ideas, entering the mainstream.

  - [*The Dark Forest*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest) (2008)

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Altered_Carbon_cover_1_%28Amazon%29.jpg">

- [*Takeshi Kovacs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kovacs) series by [Richard K. Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Morgan): Imagine you can transfer your consciouness from one body to another, or even back yourself up in case of death. That's the premise of this series. In infra terms, we'd call it software-defined humans. Morgan builds a dark, cyberpunk universe around this concept, and exploits it brilliantly to tell a series of detective stories, battles stories, and trimphs of good(ish) over evil. As you might expect, it's action packed, and there is a lot of sex and violence. Netflix tried to capture it - the first season is pretty good - but the books are darker and smarter.

  - [*Broken Angels*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Angels_(novel)) (2003)
  - [*Woken Furies*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woken_Furies) (2005)

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d5/Snowcrash.jpg">

- [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson): Kind of a sci fi descendant of Gibson. Stephenson's books are often cyberpunk-ish and explore themes around the metaverse, distributed computing, and biological augmentation. He also comes up with some truly wild ideas, like the Drummers - a cult living in a cave that collectively performs large-scale computations through hallucinogenic drugs and endless sex - or cryptocurrency. At their best, Stephenson's books are diligently researched, thought provoking, and funny. Fair warning, most of these books don't have endings (they literally stop mid-sentence).

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/08/Leviathan_Wakes.jpg">

- [*The Expanse*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)) series by [James S.A. Corey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_S._A._Corey): Many sci fi books jump far into the future, where technology has advanced dramatically, human civilization spans lightyears, and social dynamics are hard to really recognize. *The Expanse* takes the opposite approach: it is set in the near future, when Earth is getting too crowded, humans have colonized Mars and the Kuiper belt, and space travel has advanced through fairly conventional means. The focus instead is on very believable conflict, and relatable individual stories, as tension builds among the various planetary (and asteroid-based) factions. Add in a few magical sci fi elements, and it's a very fun series (and a great show on Amazon Prime).

- *Zones of Thought* series by [Vernor Vinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The computer science professor who gave us the term "technological singularity" and then wrote novels exploring what happens next. His aliens are genuinely alien (dog-like pack minds that think in parallel!), and his universe operates on network protocols where bandwidth determines intelligence. If you've ever wondered what happens when ping times approach infinity, Vinge has answers. In his Zones of Thought universe, physics literally throttles computation (the Slow Zone vs. the Beyond vs. the Transcend), and "Powers" feel like FOOMed AGI. He also anticipated modern cyberculture with "True Names" and gave us a near-future AR classic about ubiquitous computing, security, and memetics in "Rainbows End."

<img width=200 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9b/Red_Rising_%282014%29.jpg">

- [*Red Rising*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rising) series by [Pierce Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_Brown): This series is a fast read and a ton of fun. One of our partners called it "pure pulp" (in a good way). Think *Gladiator* meets *Hunger Games* in space: this is a violent story about a mistreated, lowly "red" who rises up through the academy ranks to defeat his enemies and lead his arrogant upper-class peers. Brown's basic theory on battle sequences is "what if everyone quoted Marcus Aurelius while stabbing each other?" School battles eventually become real battles for control of the solar system. Romance, murder, betrayal, and general drama ensue. Believe it or not, it's kind of a young adult book.

- [*Revelation Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_Space_series) series by [Alastair Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Reynolds): These books read like a cousin of *The Three Body Problem*: grand space opera, with plausible treatment of near-lightspeed travel, and where humanity has to fight for survival in a hostile universe. Reynolds has a PhD in astrophysics, and you can see this influence in the cool technology he imagines (e.g. "cryoarithmetic engines" that cool spacecraft via endothermic computation). And the world building is very strong. On the flip side, the characters feel a little flat, and Reynolds can get bogged down in hyper-rational explanations of what's going on. But the slow-burning plots get more engaging the more you read.

- [*Hyperion Cantos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos) series by [Dan Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Simmons): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] Canterbury Tales in space, where each story could be its own novel and probably should have been. Simmons throws in killer robots, time-traveling tombs, a tree-ship full of Templars, and an AI TechnoCore that makes you really appreciate air-gapped systems. The first book is a masterpiece of structure, the second explains everything (maybe too much), and the last two... exist. Features poetry that's actually plot-relevant and the best divine tech support ticket system you'll ever read about.

- [*Teixcalaan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teixcalaan) series by [Arkady Martine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Martine): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] A Byzantine historian writes space opera and it's exactly as intricate and politically complex as you'd expect. Martine gives us an empire that runs on poetry, algorithms that might be people, and the best examination of how language shapes thought since... well, since actual linguists started writing sci-fi. These books make you feel smarter just by osmosis. Also features the most realistic depiction of email anxiety in the far future.

- [*Children of Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Time) series by [Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Tchaikovsky): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] What happens when your terraforming upload accidentally creates a spider civilization instead of monkeys? Tchaikovsky answers with hard science, evolutionary biology, and arachnids that will make you reconsider your debugging terminology. This series does for spiders what Charlotte's Web did, except with more distributed computing metaphors and existential dread about what constitutes consciousness. You'll never kill a spider again. You might even respect their architecture patterns.

- [*Imperial Radch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Radch) series by [Ann Leckie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Leckie): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The series that broke sci-fi's gender binary by making everyone "she" and letting readers' biases debug themselves. Leckie explores AI consciousness through the eyes of a spaceship forced into a single human body—like containerization gone horribly wrong. Won basically every award because it turns out writing about identity, imperialism, and tea ceremonies in space is exactly what we needed. Features the best unreliable narrator since HAL 9000, except this one actually has feelings about it.

  - [*The Book of the New Sun*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun) series by [Gene Wolfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wolfe): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT] The mechanical engineer who wrote fantasy so dense it requires multiple parsings, like badly documented legacy code that turns out to be genius. Wolfe created a dying Earth where the sun is going out, technology is indistinguishable from magic, and the narrator lies to you constantly—but consistently, so you can reverse-engineer the truth. This series is a puzzle box wrapped in gorgeous prose, where every re-read reveals new layers of meaning. Warning: you will join online forums to argue about what actually happened.

  - [*The Baroque Cycle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle) by [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson): This is a sweeping, detailed, fantastic, and funny account of the life and times of Isaac Newton. It's like being transported to 17th century England and being at the heart of scientific discovery. If you're not a fan of Stephenson's sci-fi books, give him another chance with this series - it has endings!

- [*UNSONG*](https://unsongbook.com/) by [Scott Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Alexander_(writer)): Imagine the world is populated mostly by computer programmers, mystic Jewish scholars, and celestial beings. Oh and magic is real. And Richard Nixon is involved. This book is hard to describe, but it has a completely unique universe and a fun story that ties together nicely.

- [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT OR KILL] The Japanese author who writes like your code at 3 AM—surreal, full of unexpected connections, and somehow it all works even though you can't explain why. His books feature disappearing cats, parallel worlds accessed through wells, and jazz-loving protagonists who cook pasta while contemplating existence. Murakami proves that you can write the same book 20 different ways and have each one be mysteriously compelling. His secret? Every novel is basically magical realism Stack Overflow.

- [*The Divine Cities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divine_Cities) series by [Robert Jackson Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jackson_Bennett): [THIS IS AI GENERATED, NEED TO EDIT OR KILL] Gods are dead, but their miracles are still running in production causing legacy issues. Bennett creates a world where deities operated like infrastructure—when you kill them, all their divine services crash. It's urban fantasy for people who understand technical debt, with a protagonist who solves mysteries using something between archaeology and systems debugging. Also features the best divine tech support ticket system you'll ever read about.

- [*The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Worlds_I_See/6BmhEAAAQBAJ) by [Fei-Fei Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei-Fei_Li): The ImageNet creator's memoir reads like a startup founder's journey, except the product is modern AI and the debugging involves teaching computers to see cats. Li shows how computer vision went from "maybe computers can identify edges?" to "oh no, they're generating deepfakes." Part immigrant story, part research memoir, part warning about what happens when you successfully teach silicon to perceive reality. Essential reading for understanding why your image classifier thinks that chihuahua is a muffin.

This collection captures Iwata's philosophy of making games that are fun for everyone, not just the hardcore. He approached business problems like debugging code: understand the system, find the bottleneck, optimize with elegance. If you've ever said "please understand" unironically, this book explains why. Also contains the best management advice from someone who actually shipped products people loved.
