Most of the books on the list are, in some way, about It's heavy on science fiction, because sci-fi is the most infra-y literary genre. People who devote their lives to designing and building new systems  We hope other infra people will like these books too. People who devote their lives to It's heavy on science fiction because.. well, because we really like sci-fi. But also because people who devote their lives to building But infra is fundamentally about building new technology It has a lot of sci-fi because.. we really like sci-fi.

## Sci-fi

### Must reads (S tier)

- [*Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) series by [Frank Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert): Arrakis. Sand worms. The spice. Paul Muad'Dib. This is the series that brought epic sci-fi to the mainstream. It's also one of the first series that demonstrated sci-fi should be taken seriously, in this case as an allegory for geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In case you've only seen the (very well done) movies, do yourself a favor and read the books, which are infinitely deeper and more intricately plotted. The last three fast-forward several thousand years and get a little weird (in a good way!).
  - [*Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) (1965)
  - [*Dune Messiah*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Messiah) (1969)
  - [*Children of Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Dune) (1976)
  - [*God Emperor of Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Emperor_of_Dune) (1981)
  - [*Heretics of Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretics_of_Dune) (1982)
  - [*Chapterhouse: Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapterhouse:_Dune) (1985)

- [Philip K Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick): Dick's contribution to sci-fi is hard to overstate. All of his ~150 novels and short stories have at least one genuinely new idea: catching crime before it happens; changing who won WWII; editing human memories; etc. Most are also told in a fun and fast-paced way. His stories have been heavily adapted into movies and TV shows, and in many ways changed how we as a society think about the future. This is a very short list of some of his best works.
  - [*The Minority Report*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report) (1956)
  - [*The Man in the High Castle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle) (1962)
  - [*The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch) (1965)
  - [*We Can Remember It For You Wholesale*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Can_Remember_It_for_You_Wholesale) (1966)
  - [*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) (1968)
  - [*Ubik*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik) (1969)

- [*Culture*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series) series by [Iain M. Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_M._Banks): Sci-fi nerds love this series, but it's criminally unknown among casual readers. The setting is a hypothetical "post-scarcity" future in which space travel is trivial, machine intelligence is highly advanced, and most physical needs / desires have been solved. The books ask the question: what happens next, once we have everything we wanted? But more importantly, the stories are just beautifully crafted, and the characters (human, alien, and machine) feel completely novel. You could almost picture each book as a (really weird) dramatic play. As a bonus, if you read this series, you will get the joke about SpaceX's [spaceport names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship).
  - [*Consider Phlebas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consider_Phlebas) (1987)
  - [*The Player of Games*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Player_of_Games) (1988)

  - [*The State of the Art*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_State_of_the_Art) (1989)
  - [*Excession*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession) (1996)
  - [*Inversions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversions_(novel)) (1998)

  - [*Matter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(novel)) (2008)
  - [*Surface Detail*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Detail) (2010)
  - [*The Hydrogen Sonata*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hydrogen_Sonata) (2012)

- [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) series by [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams): An absolute classic of the Englishman-traveling-the-galaxy genre. It follows the adventures of a hapless man in his pyjamas (Arthur Dent), several incorrigible aliens, and a depressed robot, as they try their best to understand a galaxy that doesn't really make a lot of sense. This series is charming, funny, and absurd. Plus it has a real message to deliver about the meaning of life. Which turns out to be an integer (read on to find out which one!).
  - [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)) (1979)
  - [*The Restaurant at the End of the Universe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe) (1980)
  - [*Life, the Universe and Everything*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_the_Universe_and_Everything) (1982)
  - [*So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long,_and_Thanks_for_All_the_Fish) (1984)
  - [*Mostly Harmless*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostly_Harmless) (1992)
  
- [*Ender's Saga*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) series by [Orson Scott Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card): Bug-like aliens are coming for Earth at an unknown future time... that's suspiciously similar to the 1980s. Only a group of intelligent young children can save us, particularly a brilliant young leader named Ender. The story is pretty straightforward and a lot of fun, centered around a series of war simulations in the training academy. And it just really resonates emotionally for anyone who felt bullied as a kid, and/or spent most of their childhood playing video games. The sequels are also great, covering Ender's life after the war, living with and making amends for his actions as a soldier.
  - [*Ender's Game*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) (1985)
  - [*Speaker for the Dead*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_for_the_Dead) (1986)
  - [*Xenocide*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide) (1991)
  - [*Children of the Mind*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_the_Mind) (1996)

- [*Sprawl trilogy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprawl_trilogy) by [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson): Gibson is the father of cyberpunk, and his books created much of the aesthetic and vocabulary around the first internet wave (including ideas around VR, AI, and the word "cyberspace"). You can palpably feel Gibson's influence on later works like *The Matrix*, *Cyberpunk 2077*, and many many others. Reading one of these books is kind of like visiting a dystopian, high-tech, 1980s-style, Japanese-ish vision for the future. They are also just great, gritty sci-fi stories. Gibson has a talent for making you care about characters who are often rough, self-centered, and vaguely unethical. If at first you can't figure out what's going on... it's probably because Gibson was [on acid](https://highprofiles.info/interview/william-gibson/). 
  - [*Neuromancer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) (1984)
  - [*Count Zero*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Zero) (1986)
  - [*Mona Lisa Overdrive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa_Overdrive) (1988)


### Very good books (A tier)

- [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson): Stephenson is kind of a sci fi descendant of Gibson. A bunch of his book are cyberpunk-ish, and explore similar ideas around the metaverse, distributed computing, and biological augmentation. He also comes up with some truly wild ideas, like the Drummers - a cult living in a cave that collectively performs large-scale computations through hallucinogenic drugs and endless sex - or cryptocurrency. At their best, Stephenson's books are well paced, thought provoking, and funny. He develops sci fi ideas in a way that's diligent, well-researched, and satisfying. Definitely a recommended read. And he nearly makes the S tier for the "matter compilers" in *The Diamond Age*, devices that can build anything from a stream of raw molecules - possibly the most infra idea you can imagine. Fair warning: most of these books famously don't have endings (they literally stop mid-sentence during a normal plot arc).
  - [*Snow Crash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash) (1992)
  - [*The Diamond Age*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) (1995)
  - [*Cryptonomicon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon) (1999)
  - [*Anathem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem) (2008)
  - [*Seveneves*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves) (2015)

- [*Remembrance of Earth's Past*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) series by [Liu Cixin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin): The series that made Western readers realize Chinese sci-fi is terrifyingly good. Liu Cixin solves the Fermi Paradox with game theory, turns astrophysics into a horror story, and makes you grateful that SETI hasn't found anything yet. Obama loved it, Zuckerberg loved it, and you'll love it too—right up until you start looking at the night sky differently.
  - [*The Three-Body Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) (2008)
  - [*The Dark Forest*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest) (2008)
  - [*Death's End*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%27s_End) (2010)

- [*Takeshi Kovacs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kovacs) series by [Richard K. Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Morgan): What if you could back up your consciousness like a git repository and push it to any body? Morgan explores this with the subtlety of a sledgehammer and the philosophy of a cyberpunk noir detective. These books ask what "death" means when you can just restore from backup, and whether violence matters when bodies are just hardware. Netflix tried to capture it, but the books are darker, smarter, and much more fun.
  - [*Altered Carbon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon) (2002)
  - [*Broken Angels*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Angels_(novel)) (2003)
  - [*Woken Furies*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woken_Furies) (2005)
  - [*Shadows Rising*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_Rising) (2008)

- [*The Expanse*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)) series by [James S.A. Corey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_S._A._Corey): The most scientifically accurate space opera ever written, where Newton's laws are plot devices and orbital mechanics drive the action. "James S.A. Corey" is actually two guys (a former George R.R. Martin assistant and a sci-fi writer) who decided to make space feel dangerous again. No faster-than-light travel, no artificial gravity—just humans being terrible to each other across the solar system while physics watches, unimpressed.
  - [*Leviathan Wakes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_Wakes) (2011)
  - [*Caliban's War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliban%27s_War) (2012)
  - [*Abaddon's Gate*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaddon%27s_Gate) (2013)

  - [*Persepolis Rising*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_Rising) (2017)
  - [*Tiamat's Wrath*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiamat%27s_Wrath) (2019)
  - [*Leviathan Falls*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_Falls) (2021)

- [Vernor Vinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge): The computer science professor who gave us the term "technological singularity" and then wrote novels exploring what happens next. His aliens are genuinely alien (dog-like pack minds that think in parallel!), and his universe operates on network protocols where bandwidth determines intelligence. If you've ever wondered what happens when ping times approach infinity, Vinge has answers.
  - [*A Fire Upon the Deep*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep) (1992)
  - [*A Deepness in the Sky*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky) (1999)


### Also worth reading (B tier)
  
- [*Red Rising*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rising) series by [Pierce Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_Brown): This series is a fast read and a ton of fun. One of our partners called it "pure pulp" (in a good way). Think *Gladiator* meets *Hunger Games* in space: this is a violent story about a mistreated, lowly "red" who rises up through the academy ranks to defeat his enemies and lead his arrogant upper-class peers. Brown's basic theory on battle sequences is "what if everyone quoted Marcus Aurelius while stabbing each other?" School battles eventually become real battles for control of the solar system. Romance, murder, betrayal, and general drama ensue. Believe it or not, it's kind of a young adult book too.
  - [*Red Rising*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rising) (2014)
  - [*Golden Son*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Son) (2015)
  - [*Morning Star*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Star_(Brown_novel))) (2016)
  - [*Iron Gold*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Gold) (2018)
  - [*Dark Age*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Age_(Pierce_Brown_novel)) (2019)
  - [*Light Bringer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Bringer) (2023)

- [*Revelation Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_Space_series) series by [Alastair Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Reynolds): These books read like a cousin of *The Three Body Problem*: grand space opera, with plausible treatment of near-lightspeed travel, and where humanity has to fight for survival in a hostile universe. Reynolds has a PhD in astrophysics, and you can see this influence in the cool technology he imagines (e.g. "cryoarithmetic engines" that cool spacecraft via endothermic computation). And the world building is very strong. On the flip side, the characters feel a little flat, and Reynolds can get bogged down in hyper-rational explanations of what's going on. But the slow-burning plots get more engaging the more you read.

    - [*Redemption Ark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_Ark) (2002)

    - [*Machine Vendetta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Vendetta) (2024)
  - [*Chasm City*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasm_City) (2001)

- [*Teixcalaan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teixcalaan) series by [Arkady Martine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Martine): A Byzantine historian writes space opera and it's exactly as intricate and politically complex as you'd expect. Martine gives us an empire that runs on poetry, algorithms that might be people, and the best examination of how language shapes thought since... well, since actual linguists started writing sci-fi. These books make you feel smarter just by osmosis. Also features the most realistic depiction of email anxiety in the far future.
  - [*A Memory Called Empire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_Called_Empire) (2019)
  - [*A Desolation Called Peace*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Desolation_Called_Peace) (2021)

- [*Children of Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Time) series by [Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Tchaikovsky): What happens when your terraforming upload accidentally creates a spider civilization instead of monkeys? Tchaikovsky answers with hard science, evolutionary biology, and arachnids that will make you reconsider your debugging terminology. This series does for spiders what Charlotte's Web did, except with more distributed computing metaphors and existential dread about what constitutes consciousness. You'll never kill a spider again. You might even respect their architecture patterns.
  - [*Children of Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Time_(novel)) (2015)
  - [*Children of Ruin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Ruin) (2019)
  - [*Children of Memory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Memory) (2022)

- [*Imperial Radch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Radch) series by [Ann Leckie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Leckie): The series that broke sci-fi's gender binary by making everyone "she" and letting readers' biases debug themselves. Leckie explores AI consciousness through the eyes of a spaceship forced into a single human body—like containerization gone horribly wrong. Won basically every award because it turns out writing about identity, imperialism, and tea ceremonies in space is exactly what we needed. Features the best unreliable narrator since HAL 9000, except this one actually has feelings about it.
  - [*Ancillary Justice*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Justice) (2013)
  - [*Ancillary Sword*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Sword) (2014)
  - [*Ancillary Mercy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Mercy) (2015)

- [*Hyperion Cantos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos) series by [Dan Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Simmons): Canterbury Tales in space, where each story could be its own novel and probably should have been. Simmons throws in killer robots, time-traveling tombs, a tree-ship full of Templars, and an AI TechnoCore that makes you really appreciate air-gapped systems. The first book is a masterpiece of structure, the second explains everything (maybe too much), and the last two... exist. Features poetry that's actually plot-relevant and the best divine tech support ticket system you'll ever read about.
  - [*Hyperion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Simmons_novel)) (1989)
  - [*The Fall of Hyperion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_Hyperion_(novel)) (1990)
  - [*Endymion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endymion_(Simmons_novel)) (1996)
  - [*The Rise of Endymion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_Endymion) (1997)


### Historical artifacts (that are also good books)

- [HG Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells): The Victorian era's most forward-thinking pessimist, who invented time travel, alien invasions, genetic engineering, and invisible men before we even had airplanes. Wells didn't just write sci-fi—he created the entire toolkit future writers would use. Fun fact: he predicted atomic bombs in 1914, tanks in 1903, and the World Wide Web (sort of) in 1938. Not bad for a guy who thought we'd all be eating synthetic food pills by now.
  - [*The Time Machine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine) (1895)
  - [*The War of the Worlds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds) (1898)
  - [*The Invisible Man*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man) (1897)
  - [*The Island of Doctor Moreau*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau) (1896)

- [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov): The biochemistry professor who wrote 500+ books because apparently sleep is optional. Asimov gave us the Three Laws of Robotics (which every AI researcher has tried to break), psychohistory (which is just data science with a cooler name), and the idea that galactic empires run on bureaucracy. His Foundation series is basically a unit test for whether civilizations can debug themselves. Also coined the term "robotics," so we literally owe him the word.
  - [Robot series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_series_(Asimov)) (1940-1950)
  - [Galactic Empire series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(series)) (1952-1964)
  - [Foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) (1951-1966)

- [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne): The 19th century French writer who was basically running speculative fiction in production mode while everyone else was still in beta. Verne researched everything obsessively—his novels are full of accurate calculations, real science, and engineering porn before that was a thing. He predicted submarines, helicopters, and space travel with such accuracy that NASA named a lunar crater after him. The man wrote about going to the moon from Florida. In 1865. Using a giant cannon. Close enough.
  - [*Journey to the Center of the Earth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth) (1864)
  - [*Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea) (1870)
  - [*The Mysterious Island*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Island) (1874)


## Fantasy

  - [*The Book of the New Sun*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun) series by [Gene Wolfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wolfe): The mechanical engineer who wrote fantasy so dense it requires multiple parsings, like badly documented legacy code that turns out to be genius. Wolfe created a dying Earth where the sun is going out, technology is indistinguishable from magic, and the narrator lies to you constantly—but consistently, so you can reverse-engineer the truth. This series is a puzzle box wrapped in gorgeous prose, where every re-read reveals new layers of meaning. Warning: you will join online forums to argue about what actually happened.
    - [*The Shadow of the Torturer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_of_the_Torturer) (1980)
    - [*The Claw of the Conciliator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Claw_of_the_Conciliator) (1981)

  - [*The Baroque Cycle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle) by [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson): This is a sweeping, detailed, fantastic, and funny account of the life and times of Isaac Newton. It's like being transported to 17th century England and being at the heart of scientific discovery. If you're not a fan of Stephenson's sci-fi books, give him another chance with this series - it has endings!
    - [*Quicksilver*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_(novel)) (2003)
    - [*The Confusion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Confusion) (2004)
    - [*The System of the World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_System_of_the_World_(novel)) (2004)

- [*UNSONG*](https://unsongbook.com/) by [Scott Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Alexander_(writer)): Imagine the world is populated mostly by computer programmers, mystic Jewish scholars, and celestial beings. Oh and magic is real. And Richard Nixon. This book is hard to describe, but it has a completely unique universe and a fun story that ties together nicely.

  - [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami): The Japanese author who writes like your code at 3 AM—surreal, full of unexpected connections, and somehow it all works even though you can't explain why. His books feature disappearing cats, parallel worlds accessed through wells, and jazz-loving protagonists who cook pasta while contemplating existence. Murakami proves that you can write the same book 20 different ways and have each one be mysteriously compelling. His secret? Every novel is basically magical realism Stack Overflow.
   - [*Norwegian Wood*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Wood_(novel)) (1987)
   - [*Kafka on the Shore*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafka_on_the_Shore) (2002)

   - [*1Q84*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1Q84) (2009)

- [*The Divine Cities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divine_Cities) series by [Robert Jackson Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jackson_Bennett): Gods are dead, but their miracles are still running in production causing legacy issues. Bennett creates a world where deities operated like infrastructure—when you kill them, all their divine services crash. It's urban fantasy for people who understand technical debt, with a protagonist who solves mysteries using something between archaeology and systems debugging. Also features the best divine tech support ticket system you'll ever read about.
  - [*City of Stairs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Stairs) (2014)
  - [*City of Blades*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Blades) (2016)
  - [*City of Miracles*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Miracles) (2017)

- [Neil Gaiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman) books: Unfortunately Gaiman is a violent misogynist, it turns out. And his books tend to recycle similar themes. But some are still very good and worth reading, if you can separate the art from the artist.
   - [*Good Omens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens) (1990)
   - [*Stardust*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_(novel)) (2000)

## Non-fiction

- [*The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Worlds_I_See) by [Fei-Fei Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei-Fei_Li): The ImageNet creator's memoir reads like a startup founder's journey, except the product is modern AI and the debugging involves teaching computers to see cats. Li shows how computer vision went from "maybe computers can identify edges?" to "oh no, they're generating deepfakes." Part immigrant story, part research memoir, part warning about what happens when you successfully teach silicon to perceive reality. Essential reading for understanding why your image classifier thinks that chihuahua is a muffin.

This collection captures Iwata's philosophy of making games that are fun for everyone, not just the hardcore. He approached business problems like debugging code: understand the system, find the bottleneck, optimize with elegance. If you've ever said "please understand" unironically, this book explains why. Also contains the best management advice from someone who actually shipped products people loved.
