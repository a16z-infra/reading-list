## Sci-fi

### Must reads

- [*Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) series by Frank Herbert: The series that brought epic sci-fi to the mainstream. If you haven't heard of this, you're reading the wrong list. The last three books get a little weird (in a good way!).
  - *Dune* (1965)
  - *Dune Messiah* (1969)
  - *Children of Dune* (1976)
  - *God Emperor of Dune* (1981)
  - *Heretics of Dune* (1982)
  - *Chapterhouse: Dune* (1985)

- [Philip K Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick): Dick's contribution to sci-fi is hard to overstate. All of his ~150 novels and short stories have at least one genuinely new idea: catching crime before it happens; changing who won WWII; editing human memories; etc. Most are also told in a fun and fast-paced way. His stories have also been heavily adapted into movies and TV shows, and in many ways changed how we as a society think about the future. This is a very short list of some of his best works.
  - [*The Minority Report*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report) (1956)
  - [*The Man in the High Castle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle) (1962)
  - [*The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch) (1965)
  - [*We Can Remember It For You Wholesale*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Can_Remember_It_for_You_Wholesale) (1966)
  - [*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) (1968)
  - [*Ubik*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik) (1969)

- [*Culture*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series) series by Iain M. Banks: Sci-fi nerds love this series, but it's criminally unknown among casual readers. Every book is a masterpiece of relationships, technology, and inner life in a post-scarcity future. As a bonus, if you read them, you will get the joke about SpaceX's [spaceport names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship).
  - *Consider Phlebas* (1987)
  - *The Player of Games* (1988)
  - *Use of Weapons* (1990)
  - *The State of the Art* (1989)
  - *Excession* (1996)
  - *Inversions* (1998)
  - *Look to Windward* (2000)
  - *Matter* (2008)
  - *Surface Detail* (2010)
  - *The Hydrogen Sonata* (2012)

- [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) series by Douglas Adams: An absolute classic of the Englishman-traveling-the-galaxy genre. This series is charming, funny, and absurd. And it has a real message to deliver about the meaning of life. Which turns out to be an integer (read on to find out which one!).
  - *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* (1979)
  - *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* (1980)
  - *Life, the Universe and Everything* (1982)
  - *So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish* (1984)
  - *Mostly Harmless* (1992)
  
- [*Ender's Saga*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) series by Orson Scott Card: Bug-like aliens are coming for Earth at an unknown future time that's suspiciously similar to the 1980s. Only a young genius can save us. These books will make you 100% more ready to stand up to bullies, and you'llfeel good about spending your childhood playing video games.
  - *Ender's Game* (1985)
  - *Speaker for the Dead* (1986)
  - *Xenocide* (1991)
  - *Children of the Mind* (2008)

- [*Sprawl trilogy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprawl_trilogy) by William Gibson: Gibson is the father of cyberpunk, and his books created much of the aesthetic and vocabulary around the first internet wave (including ideas around VR, AI, and the word "cyberspace"). They are also just great, gritty sci-fi stories. If at first you can't figure out what's going on... it's probably because Gibson was [on acid](https://highprofiles.info/interview/william-gibson/). 
  - [*Neuromancer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) (1984)
  - [*Count Zero*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Zero) (1986)
  - [*Mona Lisa Overdrive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa_Overdrive) (1988)


### Very good books

- Neal Stephenson: The thinking engineer's novelist who treats his readers like they have PhDs in everything. Stephenson writes 900-page doorstops packed with cryptography, Sumerian mythology, nanotechnology, and Unix jokes. His books don't end so much as stop when he runs out of paper. A former programmer who worked on early Mac software, he brings an engineer's obsession with technical accuracy to every page. Fair warning: you'll learn more about 17th-century currency markets than you ever wanted to know.
  - [*Snow Crash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash) (1992)
  - [*The Diamond Age*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) (1995)
  - [*Cryptonomicon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon) (1999)
  - [*Anathem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem) (2008)
  - [*Seveneves*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves) (2015)

- Vernor Vinge's first two novels of the Zones of Thought Series, both Hugo award winners.
  - [*A Fire Upon the Deep*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep) (1992)
  - [*A Deepness in the Sky*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky) (1999)

- [*Remembrance of Earth's Past*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) series by Liu Cixin: The Chinese sci-fi trilogy that made Barack Obama and Mark Zuckerberg question humanity's place in the universe. Liu, a former power plant engineer, brings hard science to cosmic horror with concepts like the dark forest theory (spoiler: the universe is quiet because everyone's hiding). The first Asian novel to win a Hugo Award, it starts with the Cultural Revolution and ends with the heat death of the universe. Engineers will appreciate the rigorous physics, from n-body problems to dimensional weapons. Warning: may cause existential dread about answering SETI signals.
  - *The Three Body Problem* (2008)
  - *The Dark Forest* (2008)
  - *The Wandering Earth* (2010)

- [*Takeshi Kovacs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kovacs) series by Richard K. Morgan: Cyberpunk noir where death is just a hardware problem. Morgan, a former English teacher turned full-time misanthrope, created a universe where consciousness is stored in "stacks" and bodies are just "sleeves" you wear. Think Raymond Chandler meets Ghost in the Shell with extra violence. The Netflix adaptation couldn't capture the books' gleeful nihilism about what immortality does to human morality. Perfect for engineers who've ever wanted to debug human consciousness or wondered if backing up your brain counts as version control.
  - *Altered Carbon* (2002)
  - *Broken Angels* (2004)
  - *Woken Furies* (2006)
  - *Shadows Rising* (2008)

- [*The Expanse*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)) series by James S.A. Corey: An accessible space opera set in the near future. The series is about people more than the technology, and the politics (Earth vs. Mars vs. the Belt) feel very believable.
  - *Leviathan Wakes* (2011)
  - *Caliban's War* (2012)
  - *Abaddon's Gate* (2013)
  - *Cibola Burn* (2014)
  - *Nemesis Games* (2015)
  - *Babylon's Ashes* (2016)
  - *Persepolis Rising* (2017)
  - *Tiamat's Wrath* (2018)



### Historical artifacts (that are also good books)

- HG Wells: The Victorian futurist who invented half the plots sci-fi still uses today. A biology teacher turned prophet, Wells predicted tanks, nuclear weapons, and genetic engineering while Queen Victoria was still on the throne. Unlike his contemporary Jules Verne, Wells didn't care if his science was accurate—he just wanted to explore what technology would do to society. His socialist politics shine through every story about class warfare between Morlocks and Eloi. Reading Wells today is like finding the Git repository where science fiction was first committed.
  - [*The Time Machine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine) (1895)
  - [*The War of the Worlds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds) (1898)
  - [*The Invisible Man*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man) (1897)
  - [*The Island of Doctor Moreau*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau) (1896)

- Isaac Asimov: The biochemistry professor who wrote 500+ books and basically invented modern sci-fi's rulebook. Famous for the Three Laws of Robotics (which every AI safety researcher can recite), Asimov approached fiction like debugging code—identify the problem, work through the logic, solve it cleanly. His Foundation series introduced "psychohistory," essentially data science before computers existed. His prose is as dry as technical documentation, but his ideas spawned entire subgenres. Fun fact: he was afraid of flying and did most of his traveling by cruise ship, proving you can explore the galaxy without leaving your comfort zone.
  - [Robot series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_series_(Asimov)) (1940-1950)
  - [Galactic Empire series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(series)) (1952-1964)
  - [Foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) (1951-1966)

- Jules Verne: The 19th-century tech blogger who turned encyclopedic research into adventure stories. While Wells philosophized, Verne calculated—his moon shot trajectories were accurate enough that NASA engineers checked them. A French lawyer who spent his days reading scientific journals and technical manuals, he basically wrote hard sci-fi before science existed to be hard about. His heroes are engineers and his plots are GitHub README files: here's the problem, here's the technical solution, here's the step-by-step implementation. Spoiler: the implementation always works.
  - [*Journey to the Center of the Earth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth) (1864)
  - [*Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea) (1870)
  - [*The Mysterious Island*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Island) (1874)


### Pretty good books
  
- [*Red Rising*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rising) series by Pierce Brown: What happens when you refactor The Hunger Games as a space opera with Roman cosplayers. Brown, who wrote the first book on his phone while working as a NBC page, created a color-coded caste system that makes class warfare literal. Starts as YA but quickly evolves into Game of Thrones in space with razor whips. The prose runs at startup speed—all momentum and "bloodydamn" neologisms. Engineers will appreciate how the protagonist basically hacks a rigid social hierarchy using exploits the system designers never patched.
  - *Red Rising* (2014)
  - *Golden Son* (2015)
  - *Morning Star* (2016)
  - *Iron Gold* (2018)

- [*Revelation Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_Space) series by Alastair Reynolds. Tons of cool technology (cryoarithmetic engines!), well developed characters, and realistic space travel. Story is uneven, especially in the last book.
  - *Revelation Space* (2000)
  - *Absolution Gap* (2001)
  - *Redemption Ark* (2004)

- [*Teixcalaan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teixcalaan) series by Arkady Martine: Byzantine Empire meets distributed systems in this Hugo-winning duology. Martine, a Byzantine historian turned city planner, explores how empires process information and how language shapes thought (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis with spaceships). The first book is basically about debugging a political algorithm while the second asks what happens when you try to establish a communication protocol with aliens whose entire cognition is a hivemind. For engineers: it's dependency injection but for entire civilizations.
  - *A Memory Called Empire* (2017)
  - *A Desolation Called Peace* (2018)

- [*Children of Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Time) series by Adrian Tchaikovsky:
  - *Children of Time* (2015)
  - *Children of Ruin* (2017)

- [*Imperial Radch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Radch) series by Ann Leckie: The trilogy that broke sci-fi Twitter by using "she" for everyone and making readers deal with it. Leckie, who went from selling insurance to sweeping every major SF award, tells the story of a warship AI trapped in a single human body seeking revenge. Think distributed systems failure meets identity crisis meets tea addiction. The protagonist is literally a disbanded microservices architecture trying to function as a monolith. Also features the most passive-aggressive glove etiquette in literature.
  - *Ancillary Justice* (2013)
  - *Ancillary Sword* (2014)
  - *Ancillary Mercy* (2015)

- [*Hyperion Cantos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos) series by Dan Simmons: Canterbury Tales meets cosmic horror in this literary sci-fi tetralogy. Simmons, a former elementary teacher with a Romantic poetry obsession, created the Shrike—a chrome killing machine that moves backwards through time and decorates a tree with its victims. The first book is structured as nested stories (recursive functions for humanities majors), while the sequels dive into AI theology and whether love can debug the universe. Features more John Keats references than a freshman English course and the most terrifying time-debt system since technical interviews.
  - *Hyperion* (1989)
  - *The Fall of Hyperion* (1990)
  - *Endymion* (1996)
  - *The Rise of Endymion* (1998)


## Fantasy

  - [*The Book of the New Sun*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun) series by Gene Wolfe: The most unreliable narrator in fiction guides you through a dying Earth where the sun is going out and technology is indistinguishable from magic. Wolfe, an engineer who designed the machine that makes Pringles, wrote puzzles disguised as fantasy novels. Nothing is what it seems—that sword might be a spaceship, that castle might be a robot, and you definitely missed something important on page 47. Reading Wolfe is like debugging code where all the variable names are lies and the comments are in Latin. Requires multiple read-throughs to compile properly.
    - *The Shadow of the Torturer* (1980)
    - *The Claw of the Conciliator* (1982)
    - *The Sword of the Lictor* (1984)
    - *The Citadel of the Autarch* (1985)

  - [*The Baroque Cycle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle) by Neal Stephenson: This is a sweeping, detailed, fantastic, and funny account of the life and times of Isaac Newton. It's like being transported to 17th century England and being at the heart of scientific discovery. If you're not a fan of Stephenson's sci-fi books, give him another chance with this series - it has endings!
    - *Quicksilver* (2003)
    - *The Confusion* (2004)
    - *The System of the World* (2004)

- [*UNSONG*](https://unsongbook.com/) by Scott Alexander: Imagine the world is populated mostly by computer programmers, mystic Jewish scholars, and celestial beings. Oh and magic is real. And Richard Nixon. This book is hard to describe, but it has a completely unique universe and a fun story that ties together nicely.

 - Haruki Murakami books:
   - [*Norwegian Wood*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Wood_(novel)) (1987)
   - [*Kafka on the Shore*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafka_on_the_Shore) (2002)
   - [*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind-Up_Bird_Chronicle) (1994)
   - [*1Q84*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1Q84) (2009)

- [*The Divine Cities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divine_Cities) series by Robert Jackson Bennett: What if gods were real, but we killed them, and now their legacy code is breaking reality? Bennett explores post-colonial fantasy through the lens of infrastructure engineering—when your oppressors' deities maintained your plumbing, their death creates both freedom and sewage problems. Each book follows a different protagonist dealing with divine technical debt: a spy investigating miraculous glitches, a general fixing a city that exists in multiple dimensions, and an operator trying to prevent a godly resurrection/system restore. For engineers who've inherited an undocumented codebase that might be sentient.
  - *City of Stairs* (2013)
  - *City of Blades* (2014)
  - *City of Miracles* (2017)

- Neil Gaiman books: Unfortunately Gaiman is a violent misogynist, it turns out. And his books tend to recycle similar themes. But some are still very good and worth reading, if you can separate the art from the artist.
   - [*Good Omens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens) (1990)
   - [*Stardust*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_(novel)) (2000)
   - [*American Gods*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gods) (2001)
   - [*Anansi Boys*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anansi_Boys) (2005)

- [*The Lord of the Rings*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) series by J.R.R. Tolkien: Popular Hugo Weaving movie.
  - *The Fellowship of the Ring* (1954)
  - *The Two Towers* (1954)
  - *The Return of the King* (1955)


## Comic books!

- [*The Sandman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(comics)) (1989-1996)
