## Sci-fi

### Must reads

- [*Dune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) series by Frank Herbert: The series that brought epic sci-fi to the mainstream. If you haven't heard of this, you're reading the wrong list. The last three books get a little weird (in a good way!).
  - *Dune* (1965)
  - *Dune Messiah* (1969)
  - *Children of Dune* (1976)
  - *God Emperor of Dune* (1981)
  - *Heretics of Dune* (1982)
  - *Chapterhouse: Dune* (1985)

- [*Culture*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series) series by Iain M. Banks: Sci-fi nerds love this series, but it's criminally unknown among casual readers. Every book is an absolute masterpiece of relationships, technology, and inner life in a post-scarcity future. As a bonus, if you read them, you will get the joke about SpaceX's [spaceport names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship).
  - *Consider Phlebas* (1987)
  - *The Player of Games* (1988)
  - *Use of Weapons* (1990)
  - *The State of the Art* (1989)
  - *Excession* (1996)
  - *Inversions* (1998)
  - *Look to Windward* (2000)
  - *Matter* (2008)
  - *Surface Detail* (2010)
  - *The Hydrogen Sonata* (2012)

- [Philip K Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick): Dick's contribution to sci-fi is hard to overstate. All of his ~150 novels and short stories have at least one genuinely new idea, and most are told in a fun and fast-paced way. His stories have also been heavily adapted into movies and TV shows, and in many ways changed how we as a society think about the future. This is a very short list of some of his best works.
  - [*The Minority Report*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report) (1956)
  - [*The Man in the High Castle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle) (1962)
  - [*The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch) (1965)
  - [*We Can Remember It For You Wholesale*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Can_Remember_It_for_You_Wholesale) (1966)
  - [*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) (1968)
  - [*Ubik*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik) (1969)

- [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) series by Douglas Adams: An absolute classic of the Englishman-traveling-the-galaxy genre. This series is charming, funny, and absurd. And it has a real message to deliver about the meaning of life. Which turns out to be an integer (read on to find out which one!).
  - *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* (1979)
  - *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* (1980)
  - *Life, the Universe and Everything* (1982)
  - *So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish* (1984)
  - *Mostly Harmless* (1992)
  
- [*Ender's Saga*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) series by Orson Scott Card: [...]
  - *Ender's Game* (1985)
  - *Speaker for the Dead* (1986)
  - *Xenocide* (1991)
  - *Children of the Mind* (2008)

- [*Sprawl trilogy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprawl_trilogy) by William Gibson: Gibson is the father of cyberpunk, and his books created much of the aesthetic and vocabulary around the first internet wave (including the word "cyberspace"). If at first you can't figure out what's going on... it's probably because Gibson was [on acid](https://highprofiles.info/interview/william-gibson/). 
  - [*Neuromancer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) (1984)
  - [*Count Zero*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Zero) (1986)
  - [*Mona Lisa Overdrive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa_Overdrive) (1988)

    - *The Citadel of the Autarch* (1985)

  - [*The Baroque Cycle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle) by Neal Stephenson: This is a sweeping, detailed, fantastic, and funny account of the life and times of Isaac Newton. It's like being transported to 17th century England and being at the heart of scientific discovery. If you're not a fan of Stephenson's sci-fi books, give him another chance with this series - it has endings!
    - *Quicksilver* (2003)
    - *The Confusion* (2004)
    - *The System of the World* (2004)

- [*UNSONG*](https://unsongbook.com/) by Scott Alexander: Imagine the world is populated mostly by computer programmers, mystic Jewish scholars, and celestial beings. Oh and magic is real. And Richard Nixon. This book is hard to describe, but it has a completely unique universe and a fun story that ties together nicely.

 - Haruki Murakami books:
   - [*Norwegian Wood*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Wood_(novel)) (1987)

  - *City of Blades* (2014)
  - *City of Miracles* (2017)

- Neil Gaiman books: Unfortunately Gaiman is a violent misogynist, it turns out. And his books tend to recycle similar themes. But some are still very good and worth reading, if you can separate the art from the artist.

   - [*Stardust*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_(novel)) (2000)
